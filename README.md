# Expensy
* This is a Flutter application that tracks down all your expenses and gives you a net balance.
* You can also choose the category of your expense and see them easily in the form of a list with icons on the main page.
* The charts page shows the daily, monthly, weekly and yearly expenses in form of charts.
* The application uses Hive, which is a NoSQL database, to store the data and syncfusion_flutter_charts for plotting the graph.
